#
# Regression: the compressed suffix-array lookup's sentinel-row offset is
# delivered end to end through `mem --compat` (fg-labs/bwa-mem3#469).
#
# When the LF walk from an unsampled SA row reaches the sentinel (`$`) row
# before a sampled one, the coordinate is the number of steps walked. bwa's
# `bwt_sa` reports that offset; bwa-mem2 v2.2.1's pipelined lookup dropped it
# and reported 0, placing the hit up to a few bases too far left. bwa-mem3
# reports the offset by default and under `--compat=bwa-mem`, and reproduces
# the dropped offset under `--compat=bwa-mem2` (compat_target_t's
# `sa_sentinel_drop_offset`, read once per batch in `mem_chain_seeds`).
#
# The resolver itself is pinned by test/sa_lookup_sentinel_parity_test.cpp,
# which calls it directly with the flag in both positions. What that test
# cannot see is the plumbing from `--compat` to the resolver: a build that
# never passed the flag through would pass it and every other test in the
# suite. This script closes that gap by running `mem` itself.
#
# Fixture (deterministic, no PRNG): SE reads sliced from the committed phix.fa
# at offsets 0, 1 and 2 of contig 0. Only a walk that starts within the first
# few bases of the concatenated text can reach the sentinel; on phix the read
# at offset 1 is the one whose resolved seed does. Which seed the aligner
# resolves for a read depends on the read's length, so the offset-1 read is
# sliced at several lengths and the drop arm is required to show on at least
# one of them, rather than pinning the seeding of any single length.
#
# Assertions:
#   1. default and --compat=bwa-mem: every read maps to POS offset+1 with a
#      full-length match, at every length (the correct coordinate).
#   2. --compat=bwa-mem2: the offset-0 and offset-2 reads map exactly as in 1
#      (the drop moves only sentinel-reaching walks), the offset-1 read maps to
#      POS 1 or POS 2 at every length, and to POS 1 (bwa-mem2's dropped
#      offset) on at least one length. The offset-0/2 reads are the guard
#      against a vacuous pass: they prove the fixture aligns and that the only
#      moving record is the one the sentinel path owns.
