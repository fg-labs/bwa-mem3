#
# Asserts that `mem` rejects a non-positive gap-extension penalty (-E) and a
# non-positive insert-size standard deviation (-I mean,std) at parse time, with
# a clear ERROR: message, instead of dividing by zero downstream:
#   - -E 0 divides by zero in cal_max_gap; the (int) cast of the inf/NaN result
#     is UB that resolves differently per architecture (arch-divergent bands).
#   - -I mean,0 divides by zero in mem_pair; the NaN collapses every pair score
#     to 0 and silently disables pair-aware placement.
#
# Validation fires during option parsing, before the reference is opened, so
# /dev/null placeholders suffice — no fixture is needed. The message (not just a
# non-zero exit) is asserted, so a non-zero exit from a later missing-input
# error cannot masquerade as the rejection under test.
