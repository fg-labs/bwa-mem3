# Regression scripts

End-to-end parity and invariant checks. `chr22_parity.sh`,
`version_banner.sh` and `arg_range_validation.sh` run on every matrix row; the rest run on the canonical
`Linux x86_64 AVX2 (mimalloc)` row only, except for the ones wired to a job of
their own: `profile_slice_cpu.sh` runs from `profiling-build` (see below);
`host_floor_enforce.sh` and `short_read_smoke.sh` run from `rebuild-variants`,
which builds the canonical row's configuration (Linux x86_64, avx2, clang-19)
three more ways -- every opt-in debug macro on (rerunning `chr22_parity.sh`
against it), `TESTING_BUILD=1`, and `ASAN=1` (rerunning `header_parity.sh`
against it) -- in parallel with the matrix rather than at the end of the
canonical row; and the `ndebug_gate_lint*`, `debug_macro_flag_lint*`, `shell_lint*`,
`regression_coverage_lint*` and `readme_contract_lint*` pairs need no binary at
all and run from `ndebug-gate-lint`, `debug-macro-flag-lint`, `shell-lint`,
`regression-coverage-lint` and `readme-contract-lint` respectively. Each script:

- is self-contained (set -euo pipefail; explicit input contract — env vars for
  every script but the source-only lints, which instead take an optional
  positional directory so their self-tests can aim the same checks at a fixture
  tree, and `meth_oracle.sh`, which reads no input at all)
- emits `PASS:` on success and `FAIL:` on failure, and `SKIP:` where a check
  cannot run (a missing tool, a host with nothing to compare) — a skipped check
  is reported as skipped, never as a pass
- returns nonzero on failure

Where a script runs is also what backs its claim: unless a row says otherwise,
read that row's byte-identity or parity claim as holding on the canonical row —
Linux x86_64, AVX2 tier, mimalloc. Two rows say otherwise, and neither is one of
the job-of-its-own cases above. `chr22_parity.sh` runs on every matrix row, so
its parity claim is not AVX2-specific. `all_tiers_parity.sh` does run on the
canonical row, but it drives the binary through each usable tier with
`BWAMEM3_FORCE_TIER`, so the tier is the one thing its claim deliberately does
not hold fixed. (`version_banner.sh` runs everywhere too, but its row asserts no
parity or byte-identity, so nothing here scopes it.)

| Script                       | What it checks                                                        | Origin in ci.yml                                    |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `chr22_parity.sh`            | bwa vs bwa-mem3 SAM parity on ~50k PE holodeck reads (chr22)          | "Compare chr22 bwa vs bwa-mem3 (parity)"            |
| `thread_determinism.sh`      | `-t 1` == `-t 4` output after sort on chr22                           | "Thread-determinism smoke (chr22, -t 1 vs -t 4)"    |
| `all_tiers_parity.sh`        | one binary, one host: byte-identical SAM on the staged `PARITY_FA`/`PARITY_R1`/`PARITY_R2` workload (the same chr22 holodeck PE reads as `chr22_parity.sh`) whichever kernel `BWAMEM3_FORCE_TIER` selects. Real coverage needs an x86 host where both avx2 and avx512bw are sweepable; anywhere else — arm64, or x86 without AVX-512BW — there is one tier and it reports `SKIP:` | "SIMD tier parity (avx2 vs avx512bw, chr22)"        |
| `bam_roundtrip.sh`           | `--bam=6` BAM decodes and has same record count as SAM (chr22)        | "--bam=6 roundtrip smoke (chr22)"                   |
| `short_read_smoke.sh`        | ASAN SE on 25-50 bp variable-length dense-chr22 reads (PR #100 fix)   | "Short-read SE smoke (chr22, ASAN, dense+variable-length)" |
| `supp_rep_hard_cap.sh`       | `--supp-rep-hard-cap` forces MAPQ=0 on repetitive-seed supps (#101)   | "--supp-rep-hard-cap repetitive-seed regression"    |
| `repeat_chain_extension_window.sh` | extension staging copies a chain's reference window once per chain, not once per seed: 600 SE 150 bp poly-A reads (up to three G/T substitutions each) against a generated 60 kb reference holding a 20 kb poly-A run give each read a chain of ~500 max_occ-sampled seeds spanning the run, which used to grow the extension buffers past their int32 limit and abort `mem` within one batch. Asserts `mem` exits 0 on the default path and under `--meth` at `-t 1`, with every read mapped on the poly-A run and at least 100 banded-extension jobs per read (`BWAMEM3_DEDUP_STATS`), the guard that the fixture still reaches the long-chain path. The read-side window sharing is not exercised (150 bp reads cannot fill the query buffers). Env: `BWA_MEM3`; no staged inputs — the reference and reads are generated inline | "Extension staging shares a chain's reference window (homopolymer chain)" |
| `compat_byte_identical.sh`   | one binary, one host: `--compat=bwa-mem2` suppresses only `MQ`/`HN`/`@HD`, and the rest of the SAM is byte-identical to the same binary's default run on PE reads sliced from phix. bwa-mem2 itself is never run — this is a default-vs-`--compat` invariant, not a cross-aligner one. `@PG` is excluded from both sides: its `CL:` records the argv, which necessarily differs between the two runs | "--compat byte-identical regression (phix)"         |
| `dedup_byte_identity.sh`     | one binary, one host: extension-DP job dedup (`--dedup` / `BWAMEM3_DEDUP`) is byte-identical to no-dedup in every mode (`off`/`on`/`auto`) on dup-rich and low-dup PE reads sliced from phix, single- and multi-threaded; also checks the `--dedup` flag mirrors the env with the flag winning and rejects bad values. Guarded against a vacuous pass: each read carries a deterministic 3 bp deletion so gapped extension is forced and the reads reach banded SW, and a `BWAMEM3_DEDUP_STATS` check asserts total_jobs>0 (an exact-substring fixture never reaches the dedup path). `@PG` excluded (its `CL:` records argv). Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `DEDUP_PHIX_FA` (the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `DEDUP_WORK_DIR`; no staged inputs — FASTQs generated from phix | "byte-identity off==on==auto (extension-DP job dedup)" |
| `dedup_reads_byte_identity.sh` | one binary, one host: whole-read-pair memoization (`--dedup-reads` / `BWAMEM3_DEDUP_READS`) is byte-identical to no-memoization in every mode (`off`/`on`/`auto`) on dup-rich, low-dup, and N+lowercase PE reads sliced from phix, single- and multi-threaded, and the `on` path is thread-deterministic (`-t1`==`-t4`). Guarded against a vacuous pass: the flag is on-by-default (`auto`) but stays OFF on cheap alignments, so the test forces `on` and asserts via `BWAMEM3_DEDUP_READS_STATS` that dup>0 and the memo engaged (`final=ON`). The N+lowercase fixture exercises the DUP-read 2-bit conversion path that kernel1 would otherwise skip, and `BWAMEM3_DEDUP_READS_VERIFY` aligns duplicates normally and asserts their regs match the representative's field-by-field (the position-invariance claim, on real data). Also checks bad/empty `--dedup-reads` values are fatal and usage advertises the flag. `@PG` excluded (its `CL:` records argv). Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `DEDUP_READS_PHIX_FA` (the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `DEDUP_READS_WORK_DIR`; no staged inputs — FASTQs generated from phix | "byte-identity off==on==auto (whole-read-pair memoization)" |
| `ks_dedup_byte_identity.sh`  | one binary, one host: cross-read (k,s) SA-interval dedup (`--ks-dedup` / `BWA3_KS_DEDUP`) is byte-identical to no-dedup in every mode (`off`/`on`/`auto`) on dup-rich and low-dup PE reads sliced from phix, single- and multi-threaded; also checks the `--ks-dedup` flag mirrors the env with the flag winning and rejects bad/empty values for the flag and the numeric expert knobs (`BWA3_KS_DEDUP_Z`, `BWA3_KS_DEDUP_REPROBE`). Guarded against a vacuous pass: a `BWA3_KS_DEDUP_STATS` check asserts `total_pos>0` (the dedup path ran) AND `distinct_pos<total_pos` (cross-read duplicates were actually found and their LF-walks skipped). `@PG` excluded (its `CL:` records argv). Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `KS_DEDUP_PHIX_FA` (the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `KS_DEDUP_WORK_DIR`; no staged inputs — FASTQs generated from phix | "byte-identity off==on==auto (cross-read SA-interval dedup)" |
| `skip_contained_byte_identity.sh` | one binary, one host: contained-seed extension skipping is on by default and byte-identical to the reference extension path — `bwa-mem3 mem` (default) produces SAM identical to `--keep-contained-ext` (opt-out) on a dup-rich and a low-dup PE fixture sliced from phix, at `-t 1` and `-t 4` (ordering is contractually deterministic across thread counts). Also asserts the deprecated `--skip-contained-ext` is an accepted no-op (== default output) that prints its deprecation notice to stderr. `@PG` excluded (its `CL:` records argv). Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `SKIP_CONTAINED_PHIX_FA` (the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `SKIP_CONTAINED_WORK_DIR`; no staged inputs — FASTQs generated from phix | "byte-identity default==--keep-contained-ext (contained-seed skip)" |
| `hic_alias_identical.sh`     | one binary, one host: `--hic` is byte-identical to `-5SP` on PE reads sliced from phix (#368). Two guards keep it from passing vacuously — `--hic` output must differ from a plain run, and the whole-file `FLAG` `0x2` counts must show the plain run with at least one proper-pair record while the `--hic` run has exactly zero (a total count over all records, not restricted to records that overlap the plain run). `@PG` is excluded from both sides: its `CL:` records the argv, which differs by construction. Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `HIC_PHIX_FA` (must point at the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `HIC_WORK_DIR`; no staged inputs — the FASTQs are generated from phix | "--hic alias regression (byte-identical to -5SP)"    |
| `band_cert_identity.sh`      | one binary, one host: the certified adaptive extension band (default on) is byte-identical to the full-width ladder — `bwa-mem3 mem` and `bwa-mem3 mem --no-band-cert` produce identical SAM (and BAM records, if samtools is present) on PE reads sliced from phix, `@PG` excluded from both sides (its `CL:` records the argv, which differs). A source guard pins the wiring not observable on phix's short reads: `band_cert` defaults on, and `--fast`/`--adaptive-band`/`--no-band-cert` clear it. Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `BAND_CERT_PHIX_FA` (the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `BAND_CERT_WORK_DIR`; no staged inputs — the FASTQs are generated from phix | "band_cert byte-identical regression (--no-band-cert A/B, phix)" |
| `chain_flt_empty_compat.sh` | one binary, one host: when `mem_chain_flt`'s weight filter drops every chain, each `--compat` target reproduces its own upstream (#310) — `--compat=bwa-mem2` maps all reads (bwa-mem2 resurrects the rejected slot-0 chain), while the default and `--compat=bwa-mem` map none (bwa returns zero survivors and the read goes out unmapped; the default takes the fix). Triggered with `-W 200` on 150 bp phix reads rather than a `-x` preset, because `-W` above the read length makes the path exact rather than probabilistic — on 500 real HiFi reads at `-x pacbio` it never fires. Guarded against a vacuous pass: the same reads must all map at `-W 0` under all three configurations. Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `CHAIN_FLT_PHIX_FA` (the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `CHAIN_FLT_WORK_DIR`; no staged inputs — the FASTQ is generated from phix | "chain-flt empty-array compat regression (#310)" |
| `compat_sa_sentinel.sh` | one binary, one host: a read whose compressed-SA walk reaches the sentinel row is placed at its true coordinate by default and under `--compat=bwa-mem`, and one base too far left under `--compat=bwa-mem2` (bwa-mem2 v2.2.1's dropped walk offset, #469), on SE reads sliced from the first bases of phix at several lengths; the neighbouring reads must not move under any target, which is the guard against a vacuous pass. Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `SA_SENTINEL_PHIX_FA` (the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `SA_SENTINEL_WORK_DIR`; no staged inputs — the reads are sliced from phix | "SA sentinel-offset compat regression (#469)" |
| `mimalloc_purge_delay.sh` | one binary, one host: `mem` runs with mimalloc's purge delay at -1 (never purge) by default; `MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY` and its legacy alias `MIMALLOC_RESET_DELAY` override it, as does the lower-case spelling `mimalloc_purge_delay` (mimalloc matches names case-insensitively); a value mimalloc cannot parse (`1s`, whether the name is upper- or lower-case) keeps -1 and prints a `[W::main]` warning naming it, while an explicit `-1` and a boolean word mimalloc accepts (`off` -> 0) do not warn; and the SAM is byte-identical between never purging and purging immediately (`MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY=0`) over several batches (`-K 1000`, asserted to give at least two), so per-batch buffers really are freed and reused. Also checks that `index` does not print the purge-delay line, which shows the `mem` reporting path is not reached from `index` but cannot prove the default itself stays out of it. Observed through the `[M::main] mimalloc purge delay:` stderr line, which reads the value back from mimalloc. Reports `SKIP:` on a binary that does not run on mimalloc, or `FAIL:` when `PURGE_MIMALLOC_REQUIRED` is set (CI sets it for the canonical build). Env: `BWA_MEM3`, `PURGE_PHIX_FA` (the committed `test/fixtures/phix.fa`), `PURGE_MIMALLOC_REQUIRED` (optional), `PURGE_WORK_DIR` (each run works in its own `mktemp -d` subdirectory, removed on exit); no staged inputs — the reads are sliced from phix | "mimalloc purge delay regression (mem default, env override, byte-identity)" |
| `header_parity.sh`           | `AH:*` on generated `@SQ` (#281); `--compat` skips the .hdr/.dict sidecar | "header parity regression (AH:*, --compat @HD/@SQ)" |
| `proper_pair_alt.sh`         | `--proper-pair-from-emitted` derives `FLAG` `0x2` from the emitted `a[which]` rather than the default `a[0]` (#17, #362), on a generated 2-contig ALT fixture whose one divergent pair emits on the ALT contig over a sub-`T` primary hit. Asserts the bit flips, that `FLAG` is the only field that differs and differs by exactly bit `0x2`, and that the option is inert on the same reference without a `.alt` sidecar. Generates its own fixture — no staged inputs, but `PROPER_PAIR_ALT_WORK_DIR` must name a directory of its own, since the script deletes the fixture files it owns there on entry | "proper-pair ALT derivation regression (--proper-pair-from-emitted)" |
| `default_hd_parity.sh`       | one binary, one host: default `@HD` byte-identical across SAM/`--bam`/`--meth` on PE reads sliced from phix (#288) | "default @HD parity across output paths"            |
| `alt_pa_parity.sh`           | one binary, one host: `pa:f:` decodes to the same float32 in SAM text and `--bam`, and carries no more than three decimals, on a generated ALT-aware fixture whose reads come from the ALT contig — the only non-`--meth` fixture in this directory that makes `alt_sc` positive, so the only one that emits `pa` at all (#365). Default path only (`mem_aln2sam` vs `mem_aln_to_bam`); the `--meth` writer is covered by `meth_alt_pa_parity.sh`. Compares the decoded float, not the text `samtools view` prints, which renders an `f` field with `%g` | "pa:f: SAM vs --bam parity (ALT-aware fixture)"     |
| `meth_alt_pa_parity.sh`      | one binary, one host: `--meth` renders `pa:f:` from the same shared definition the SAM-text writer uses — every value is the float32 of a three-decimal rendering, secondary records carry none, and `SA:Z` precedes it (#365). Needed separately because `meth_mem_aln_to_bam` is a third, independent writer and its fixture has to be bisulfite-converted as well as ALT-aware | "pa:f: --meth parity (ALT-aware bisulfite fixture)" |
| `meth_sam_output.sh`         | `--meth` emits SAM text by default and BAM under `--bam`, same records | "--meth output container follows --bam"             |
| `meth_collapsed_scoring.sh`  | `--meth-scoring collapsed` also frees the conversion mirror cell, so a ref-T→read-C substitution scores `a+b` above `genomic` and reports NM=0 against its NM=1 | "--meth whole-aligner regressions (D3)"             |
| `meth_oracle.sh`             | `--meth` Layer 1 (valid BAM emission) via the harness under `test/meth/`; Layers 2–3 retired in D3 | "Run --meth Layer 1"                                |
| `cohort_ramp_validation.sh`  | `--cohort-ramp-first`/`-ratio` reject malformed values; env warns and falls back | "Cohort ramp values are validated (flag and environment alike)" |
| `rescue_kmer_options.sh`     | `--rescue-kmer`/`--rescue-band` reject malformed and out-of-range values; the `=` form is required | "--rescue-kmer/--rescue-band reject malformed values" |
| `rescue_skip_options.sh`     | `--rescue-skip` (optional `true`/`false`, bare = true, `=`-attached value) requires `--rescue-kmer` when enabled (order-independent), rejects malformed/space-form values, and is NOT enabled by `--fast` | "--rescue-skip requires --rescue-kmer and composes with --fast" |
| `thread_count_validation.sh` | `-t` rejects malformed values (non-numeric, trailing garbage, empty, overflow); a value <= 0 still floors to 1; a value above `MAX_THREADS` (256) is clamped to 256 with a warning rather than rejected | "-t rejects malformed values and clamps out-of-range values" |
| `profile_slice_cpu.sh`       | `--profile` accounts for a partial cohort slice's compute CPU (needs `STAGE_PROF=1`) | "Partial cohort slices report their compute CPU"    |
| `ndebug_gate_lint.sh`        | no `#if`/`#ifdef`/`#ifndef`/`#elif` NDEBUG gates in `src/` — nothing here defines NDEBUG, so they never compile out | "No NDEBUG preprocessor gates in src/"              |
| `ndebug_gate_lint_selftest.sh` | the lint above still flags real gates, so its `PASS` means something | "NDEBUG gate lint still detects gates"              |
| `debug_macro_flag_lint.sh`   | the opt-in macro build's `-D` list and the `BWA_MEM3_DEBUG_*` macros in `src/` still name each other | "Opt-in macro -D list matches the macros in src/"   |
| `debug_macro_flag_lint_selftest.sh` | the lint above still detects a drifted list, so its `PASS` means something | "Macro list lint still detects drift"               |
| `shell_lint.sh`              | every tracked `*.sh` is shellcheck-clean and shfmt-formatted           | "Tracked shell scripts are shellcheck-clean and shfmt-formatted" |
| `shell_lint_selftest.sh`     | the lint above still rejects bad scripts, so its `PASS` means something | "Shell lint still detects bad scripts"             |
| `regression_coverage_lint.sh` | every script in this directory is named by a CI workflow, or by a Makefile target CI invokes — not just by `make test` | "Every regression script is run by CI"              |
| `regression_coverage_lint_selftest.sh` | the lint above still detects an unrun script, so its `PASS` means something | "Coverage lint still detects an unrun script"       |
| `host_floor_enforce.sh`      | below-floor hosts get exit 2 + a readable error, not a SIGILL; a forced sub-AVX2 tier (x86) refuses `mem` but not `version` (needs `TESTING_BUILD=1`) | "SIMD floor enforcement (TESTING_BUILD, injected below-floor tier)" |
| `version_banner.sh`          | `bwa-mem3 version` prints the SIMD floor and runtime tier lines        | "Version banner regression"                         |
| `arg_range_validation.sh`    | `-E` (`0`, `5,0`, and out-of-range tokens that would narrow to a positive int) and `-I mean,0` are rejected at parse with an `ERROR:` message (cal_max_gap / mem_pair divide-by-zero); also rejects non-finite `-I` mean/std/max (`nan`/`inf`, and overflowing tokens like `1e400` that `strtod` maps to `inf`). Env: `BWA_MEM3`; no staged inputs — validation fires during option parsing, before any reference is opened | "Argument range validation (-E / -I reject non-positive)" |
| `readme_contract_lint.sh`    | this README names no script that was deleted, its source-only-lint block lists exactly the scripts that read no environment, every row's `Origin in ci.yml` names a step a workflow defines, and every script can emit the `PASS:`/`FAIL:` markers above | "README still describes the regression scripts"     |
| `readme_contract_lint_selftest.sh` | the lint above still detects a stale README, so its `PASS` means something | "README lint still detects drift"                  |

The table is a reading guide, not an inventory — `ls test/regression/*.sh` is
the authoritative list, and `ci.yml` is where each one is actually wired up.

Every script but the ones named in the block below reads its inputs from
environment variables — see the comment block at the top of each file.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` sets the required vars and invokes the scripts.

<!-- source-only lints: begin -->
These scripts read no environment at all.

The source-only lints each take the directory to work on as an optional
positional argument, so that its self-test can aim the same checks at a fixture
tree; each self-test takes no input, since it builds the trees it aims its lint
at.

| Lint | Positional argument | Self-test |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| `ndebug_gate_lint.sh`         | directory to scan (default `src/`)                  | `ndebug_gate_lint_selftest.sh`         |
| `debug_macro_flag_lint.sh`    | repository root to check (default: this repository) | `debug_macro_flag_lint_selftest.sh`    |
| `regression_coverage_lint.sh` | repository root to check (default: this repository) | `regression_coverage_lint_selftest.sh` |
| `readme_contract_lint.sh`     | repository root to check (default: this repository) | `readme_contract_lint_selftest.sh`     |

`meth_oracle.sh` is the one env-free script that is not a lint, and it takes no
argument either. It wraps the `--meth` harness under `test/meth/`, whose inputs
are the gitignored fixtures CI copies in there, plus an optional `SAMTOOLS`
naming a samtools off `PATH`; the wrapper's whole job is to invoke that harness
and mark the result, so it passes the environment through rather than reading
or pinning any of it. "Reads no environment" is a claim about each script
itself — which is also how `readme_contract_lint.sh` decides it — not about
everything it may go on to run.
<!-- source-only lints: end -->

`readme_contract_lint.sh` checks that block against the scripts themselves, so
a script that stops reading the environment without gaining a mention here
fails CI rather than going unnoticed.

One exception to "any binary will do": `profile_slice_cpu.sh` asserts on
`--profile` output, which a default build compiles out entirely, so it needs a
binary from `make STAGE_PROF=1`. It fails loudly rather than skipping if handed
one without `--profile`, and CI runs it from the `profiling-build` job.
