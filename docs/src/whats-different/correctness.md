# Correctness Fixes

This page documents bugs present in upstream bwa-mem2 that bwa-mem3 fixes. Each
fix is isolated to a single PR so it can be reviewed independently and dropped
from `main` once upstream merges the equivalent patch.

## `@PG CL:` tab escaping (PR #54)

When a read-group string is passed via `-R '@RG\tID:x\tSM:y'`, the tab
characters in the argument were copied verbatim into the `@PG CL:` SAM header
field. The SAM specification uses tabs as field delimiters, so the resulting
header line appeared to have extra `ID:` and other tag fields embedded inside
`CL:`. Lenient parsers (samtools, htsjdk) tolerated the output; strict parsers
(noodles, some fgbio configurations) rejected the file as malformed.

The fix replaces each tab character with a space when building the `@PG CL:`
value in `src/main.cpp`. The `@RG` line itself is not modified, so the
read-group metadata is preserved correctly. A regression shell test
(`test/pg_cl_escape_test.sh`) asserts that the `@PG` line contains exactly
five tab-separated fields after the fix. Upstream issue reference:
[bwa-mem2#293](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2/issues/293).

## SMEM buffer overflow on reads longer than 151 bp (PR #55)

bwa-mem2 hardcoded `READ_LEN 151` in `src/macro.h` to size the per-thread
`matchArray` SMEM buffer at compile time. The FMI walk wrote past this buffer
without bounds checking when reads exceeded 151 bp, causing memory corruption
that manifested as segfaults or silent wrong output on 300 bp MiSeq reads,
error-corrected long reads, and any run with a non-default `-k` that extended
seed length.

A second cap, `MAX_READ_LEN_FOR_LOCKSTEP 512`, guarded the lockstep driver's
per-slot stack arrays with a hard assert that aborted on anything longer.

The fix eliminates both compile-time caps. Every per-thread SMEM buffer is now
heap-allocated on the memory management context (`mmc`) and grown on demand
from each batch's observed `max_readlength`. The pre-walk grow in
`mem_collect_smem` sizes `matchArray[tid]` to `BATCH_MUL * BATCH_SIZE *
max_readlength`, and all array writes are bounds-checked with a structured
`smem_overflow_die` on overflow. Regression tests cover 300 bp, 1 kbp, and
3 kbp phiX reads; all three segfaulted before the fix and produce correct
NM:i:0 alignments after. Upstream references:
[bwa-mem2#210](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2/issues/210) (issue),
[bwa-mem2#238](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2/pull/238)
(closed unmerged upstream PR).

## `kswv` nrow==0 guard (PR #51)

When a SIMD batch contained only padding pairs (all `len1 == 0`), the DP loop
never executed and `nrow` was zero. The post-loop `rowMax + (i-1) * SIMD_WIDTH`
store still executed, walking SIMD_WIDTH bytes before the beginning of the
`rowMax` allocation. On glibc this produced a `free(): invalid pointer` abort;
on macOS libc it silently corrupted the heap.

The fix wraps the post-loop store in an `if (i > 0)` guard on all five SIMD
kswv kernels: NEON u8, NEON 16, AVX2 u8, AVX-512BW u8, and AVX-512BW 16. The
upstream patch [bwa-mem2#289](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2/pull/289)
covered only the two AVX-512BW kernels; bwa-mem3 broadens it to the three
additional kernels carried in this fork. A dedicated regression test
(`test/kswv_nrow_zero_test.cpp`) builds all-padding batches and verifies each
kernel is clean under AddressSanitizer.

## kswv score2 plateau series (PRs #26, #27, #28, #29, #30, #31)

The batched mate-rescue Smith-Waterman path (`kswv`) contains a family of
related bugs across its SIMD kernels that inflated the suboptimal score
(`score2` / `XS`) and consequently deflated MAPQ relative to upstream
bwa-mem2.

**AVX-512BW dispatch guard (PR #26).** GCC with `-mavx512bw` automatically
defines `__AVX2__`, so the `#elif __AVX2__` branch in `src/kswv.h` and
`src/kswv.cpp` matched first on every AVX-512BW build. The 256-bit AVX2 kernel
produced only 32-lane results into 64-lane `score[]`/`te1[]`/`qe[]` arrays
sized for AVX-512BW; the upper 32 lanes held uninitialized values.
`mem_matesw_batch_post` read those bogus `te` values, `bwa_gen_cigar2`
returned NULL, and `mem_reg2aln` triggered an `a.cigar != NULL` assertion on
every AVX-512BW dispatch host (AWS c7a, c7i). The fix qualifies the `#elif
__AVX2__` guard with `!__AVX512BW__`, matching the existing pattern in
`bandedSWA.h`. Closes [issue #25](https://github.com/fg-labs/bwa-mem3/issues/25).

**AVX2 score2 plateau fix (PR #27 closed, PR #28 merged).** The AVX2 256-bit
`kswv` kernel added in PR #20 used a dense SIMD max over every `rowMax` row to
compute the suboptimal score. Scalar `ksw_u8` instead collapses consecutive
rows above `minsc` into a single `b[]` entry anchored at the max-score row,
then finds the best anchor outside the primary region. The dense max pulled in
tail rows from a plateau whose anchor sat inside the primary region, inflating
`XS` by 1–4 on a minority of reads and reducing MAPQ by 2–18 on those reads.
PR #27 (closed) temporarily disabled the AVX2 batched path. PR #28 fixes the
kernel itself by replacing the dense scan with a per-lane scalar emulation of
the `b[]` build-and-scan logic.

**NEON and AVX-512BW 8-bit port (PR #29).** The same dense-rowMax score2 scan
existed in `kswv_neon_u8` and `kswv_512_u8`. Confirmed on ARM: rebuilding
smoke-1M on darwin/arm64 pre-fix produced the identical four MAPQ regressions
as the AVX2 case. PR #29 ports the per-lane scalar `b[]`-emulation fix to both
kernels.

**AVX-512BW 16-bit port (PR #30).** `kswv_512_16` carried four bugs: the same
dense-rowMax plateau pattern, aggregate `maxl`/`minh` bounds instead of
per-lane bounds (a gap from PR #21), no `minsc` filter, and no `qe` mask. The
per-lane scalar emulation from PR #29 fixes all four naturally.

**NEON 16-bit rewrite (PR #31).** `kswv_neon_16` was effectively dead code
before this PR. Five interacting bugs produced 20,435 BAM diffs vs scalar
reference on smoke-1M `-A 2`: the score table reinterpreted `int16` xor
indices as `int8` lookups (inflating match scores by ~256 per cell), the table
was too small for the 16-bit SoA encoding, `rowMax` was never written, the
early-exit fired on row 0 for all pairs without a `KSW_XSTOP` target, and all
the fix-3 class bugs from PRs #28–#30 were missing. The PR rewrites the kernel
from scratch against `kswv_neon_u8`'s structure using 32-byte `int8` tables
indexed via `vqtbl2_s8`, per-lane freeze, `exit0` bitmap, and per-lane scalar
score2.

## `kseq2bseq1` zero-initialization (PR #22)

`bseq_read_orig` grows its sequence buffer with `realloc`, leaving tail entries
uninitialized. `kseq2bseq1` populated only `name`, `comment`, `seq`, `qual`,
and `l_seq` for each entry, leaving `sam`, `bams`, `n_bams`, and `cap_bams` at
whatever values `realloc` happened to return. PR #13 added an unconditional
`free(ret->seqs[i].bams)` in the output loop (`fastmap.cpp:571`), which turned
those garbage values into a crash — a `pointer being freed was not allocated`
abort under system malloc and a SIGSEGV under mimalloc — once input exceeded
the initial 256-sequence allocation. The crash was deterministic and
reproducible with `-t1`.

The fix is a single `memset(s, 0, sizeof(*s))` at the top of `kseq2bseq1`.

## Proper-pair flag from emitted alignment (PR #17)

In the `no_pairing` emission path of `mem_sam_pe` and `mem_sam_pe_batch_post`,
the proper-pair bit (`0x2`) was computed from `a[i].a[0].rb` regardless of
which alignment was actually emitted. When the primary's alignment score fell
below the reporting threshold `opt->T` but a non-primary ALT hit cleared it,
`mem_reg2aln` emitted `a[i].a[n_pri[i]]` while `mem_infer_dir` still read the
below-threshold primary. In that case the SAM flag did not reflect the
coordinates in the record.

`#17` stored the selected alignment index per mate in a `which[2]` array and
passed `a[i].a[which[i]].rb` to `mem_infer_dir`, so the proper-pair flag matched
the emitted record. **That derivation is now opt-in**: since
[#362](https://github.com/fg-labs/bwa-mem3/issues/362) the default reads `a[0]`,
as bwa and bwa-mem2 do, and `a[which]` is selected only under
`--proper-pair-from-emitted` — see the note below for why. The `a[0]` derivation
was present in the bwa-mem2 initial commit from 2019, inherited from bwa, which
still has it at 0.7.19 (`bwamem_pair.c:411`). Upstream reference: pre-existing,
no open upstream PR.

> **Opt-in since [#362](https://github.com/fg-labs/bwa-mem3/issues/362) — the
> default now matches both upstreams.** `0x2` is aligner-defined ("properly
> aligned according to the aligner"), so deriving it from `a[which]` is a
> defensible choice rather than a correction — and as a *default* it made
> bwa-mem3's output differ from bwa **and** bwa-mem2 simultaneously. The

## 8-bit banded-SW envelope cap at `w = 124` (PR #422)

`bsw8_envelope_ok` — the gate that routes a seed-extension pair to the 8-bit
banded-SW kernel — admitted band widths up to `BSW8_MAX_W = 127`. The 8-bit kernel
encodes its band/position quantities as **signed-int8 diagonal offsets** spanning
`[-(w+1), w+3]` (the band-grow term `myband+1` and the tail-trim term `index+2`,
which reaches `w+3`). At `w >= 125` the positive edge `w+3` exceeds `+127` and wraps
negative: the band collapses on row 0, `head > tail`, and lanes die mid-alignment —
the pair then silently returns "no extension" (`score = h0`, `tle = qle = 0`,
`gscore = -1`) where the scalar and 16-bit kernels return the real extension. The
fix drops `BSW8_MAX_W` to **124**, so `w` in {125, 126, 127} route to the 16-bit
tier (exact, byte-identical to scalar) instead.

The overflow begins at `w >= 125`; `-w 127` is the characterized case — the one
user-supplied width that reaches the wrap on essentially every 8-bit-routed
extension (the wide-band retry doubling to 200/400 is already diverted to 16-bit).
`w = 125/126` also cross the boundary but corrupt only exotic pair shapes, so `-w 127`
is the width the tests reproduce. The default `opt->w = 100` never reaches the 8-bit
cap, so the drop-in path is **byte-identical** — verified by a records-only
(header-excluded) whole-aligner md5 on a 2×150 bp WGS workload, where `-w 100` output
is identical to `main`. A `getScores8` characterization test
(`test/unit/test_bandedswa_longread.cpp`, all six result fields vs the scalar
`scalarBandedSWA` oracle across the SIMD tiers exercised in CI) is byte-identical at
the `w = 124` bound and diverges at `w = 127`, locking the reason for the cap; at
`-w 127` this branch's records-only md5 matches an all-16-bit reference while `main`'s
8-bit tier differs.

## Vector banded-SW z-drop gate at `-d 0` (PR #424)

`scalarBandedSWA` gates its z-drop early-exit on `zdrop > 0`, so with z-drop
disabled (`-d 0`) it never truncates. The vector banded-SW kernels (8-bit and
16-bit, every SIMD tier) applied the z-drop test **unconditionally**: at
`zdrop == 0` they compared the running drop against a zero threshold and killed a
lane as soon as its score fell one point below the row max, truncating alignments
the scalar reference runs to completion. The two then disagreed on the query-end
fields (`gscore`/`gtle`), and once the vector stopped early, on the local fields
(`score`/`tle`/`qle`/`max_off`) too. The fix gates all six vector z-drop mask
updates (the three `ZSCORE16` macros and the three 8-bit wide-`epi32` paths) on
`zdrop > 0`, matching the scalar.

The effect is confined to **`-d 0` (z-drop disabled)**, where essentially all
extension pairs previously diverged between the vector tiers and the scalar
reference; disabled z-drop now preserves the alignments the old kernels wrongly
truncated. On the default `-d 100` the guarded branch is always taken, so the
kernels are **byte-identical** there and the drop-in path is unchanged. This was
verified by a controlled records-only (header-excluded) whole-aligner md5 A/B —
control (`main`) versus this branch on identical inputs, default flags, and
batching (`-K` held fixed for both runs) — on a 2×150 bp WGS workload (HG002,
hg38): the default-`-d 100` output matches the pre-fix baseline on both the ARM64
(NEON) and x86_64 (AVX2) tiers. At `-d 0` the fixed kernels' records-only md5
instead equals that same default-flags output — disabling z-drop preserves
exactly the alignments the default z-drop leaves untruncated on these reads —
while the old kernels diverge. A standalone kernel byte-identity gate also passes
at default parameters (extend and rescue). A regression test
(`test/unit/test_bandedswa_zdrop_gate.cpp`) compares `getScores8`/`getScores16` at
`zdrop == 0` to `scalarBandedSWA` on NEON, AVX2, and AVX-512BW: it fails on the old
kernels and passes on the fixed ones.

## 16-bit banded-SW per-lane band clamp (PR #423)

The three 16-bit banded-SW wrappers (`smithWatermanBatchWrapper16`, at 128/256/512
bits) computed the per-lane band-clamp reach with a **16-bit modular add**, reading
the sum back through a `uint16_t`. Because `qlen[l]` already holds `qlen * max_sc`,
the reach `qlen*max_sc + (end_bonus - o)` can go negative (a short query under a
large gap-open, e.g. `-O16`) or exceed 65535; the 16-bit add then wraps and the
clamp evaluates to a huge band that effectively disappears, so `getScores16` runs
the full band `w` where the scalar reference (`scalarBandedSWA`) clamps it as narrow
as 1. The 8-bit wrappers were already fixed for this; this ports the identical wide
`int` computation (mirroring the scalar "adjust `w` if it is too large" block) to
the three 16-bit wrappers.

The effect is scoped to **non-default scoring** (`-B9 -O16 -E3` and similar) on
short-query pairs, where the mis-sized band diverged from the scalar reference on
the query-end fields (`gscore`/`gtle`) and could change `score`, endpoints, and the
emitted alignment records. On bwa's default `-O6 -E1` at normal read lengths the
intermediate provably never wraps, so the wide-int path computes the identical
band and the drop-in path is **byte-identical by construction** — an
integer-arithmetic invariant that holds independent of host, compiler, and thread
count, so the proof (not any single benchmark) is the load-bearing evidence. A
controlled records-only (header-excluded) whole-aligner md5 A/B corroborates it:
control (`main`) versus this branch on a 2×150 bp WGS workload (HG002, hg38) at
default flags, with inputs, flags, thread count (`-t`), and batching (`-K`) all
held fixed across the two runs — so the batch composition is identical — on both
the ARM64 (NEON) and x86_64 (AVX2 and AVX-512BW) tiers. A `getScores16` band-clamp
regression test (`test/unit/test_bandedswa_band_clamp.cpp`) compares `score`,
`tle`, `qle`, and `max_off` to the `scalarBandedSWA` oracle unconditionally, and
`gscore`/`gtle`
only when either side reports `gscore > 0` (a to-end alignment is observable),
across the wrap scoring sets on NEON, AVX2, and AVX-512BW: it fails on the old
kernel and passes on the fixed one.
