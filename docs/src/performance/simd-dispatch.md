# SIMD Dispatch Matrix

bwa-mem3 ships **one binary per platform**. The x86 binary contains
compiled kernels for every supported SIMD tier
(`sse41` / `sse42` / `avx` / `avx2` / `avx512bw`) and dispatches in
process at startup. The arm64 binary contains a single NEON kernel
path. There are no `bwa-mem3.<tier>` companion files on disk and no
launcher binary.

## Dispatch flowchart

    A[bwa-mem3 mem starts] --> B{Platform?}
    B -- ARM / aarch64 --> C[NEON kernel TU, no dispatch]
    B -- x86 --> D[bwamem3_simd_init in src/simd_dispatch.cpp]
    D --> E[__builtin_cpu_supports]
    E --> F{Host capability?}
    F -- AVX-512BW --> G1[g_tier = avx512bw]
    F -- AVX2 --> G2[g_tier = avx2]
    F -- AVX --> G3[g_tier = avx]
    F -- SSE4.2 --> G4[g_tier = sse42]
    F -- SSE4.1 --> G5[g_tier = sse41]
    F -- below build floor --> H[exit(2): host below SIMD floor]
    G1 & G2 & G3 & G4 & G5 --> I[Per-kernel factory selects matching tier]
```

Tier detection runs once during `main()`. Subsequent kernel calls pay
a single indirect-call hop through a factory vtable (or an
`extern "C"` wrapper for free-function `ksw_*` kernels) — about
0.3 ns per call after BTB warm-up, well below run-to-run noise on the
[bwa-mem3-bench](https://github.com/fg-labs/bwa-mem3-bench) corpus.

If the host CPU does not meet the build's compile-time SIMD floor
(`BASELINE_ARCH`, default `avx2` since PR #84), the binary exits with
code 2 and an `[E::bwamem3]` message naming the gap before any
alignment work runs. `bwa-mem3 version`, `--help`, and `-h` are
exempt and always succeed so operators can introspect a binary on a
host that cannot run alignment. See
[Host requirements](../getting-started/host-requirements.md).

## Building

```bash
make                              # single multi-tier x86 binary, BASELINE_ARCH=avx2
make BASELINE_ARCH=sse41          # lower host SIMD floor / maximize portability (~10–15% slower on AVX2 hosts)
make BASELINE_ARCH=avx512bw       # AVX-512BW-only fleet (locks the host floor)
make arm64                        # single NEON binary, no dispatch table
```

`BASELINE_ARCH` controls the tier at which non-kernel translation
units compile. The hand-tuned kernel TUs in `KERNEL_SRCS`
(`bandedSWA`, `kswv`, `ksw`, `sam_encode`) are always compiled at
every supported tier and dispatched at runtime, so a build at
`BASELINE_ARCH=avx2` still uses the AVX-512BW kernels on AVX-512BW
hosts. The non-kernel TUs are not auto-vectorized above
`BASELINE_ARCH`, which is the trade-off — see
[`BASELINE_ARCH=avx512bw` build flag](../whats-different/avx512-baseline.md)
for the empirical perf characterization.

Supported x86 tiers (minimum CPU for each tier's kernel path):

| Tier | Arch flags | Minimum CPU |
|---|---|---|
| `sse41` | `-msse4.1` | Penryn (2007) / K10 (2011) |
| `sse42` | `-msse4.2` | Nehalem (2008) / Bulldozer (2011) |
| `avx` | `-mavx` | Sandy Bridge (2011) / Bulldozer (2011) |
| `avx2` | `-mavx2` | Haswell (2013) / Excavator (2015) |
| `avx512bw` | `-mavx512f -mavx512bw -mprefer-vector-width=256` | Skylake-X (2017) / Zen 4 (2022) |

For arm64 builds:

| Binary | Arch flags | Platform |
|---|---|---|
| `bwa-mem3` (arm64) | `-DAPPLE_SILICON=1` + native NEON / sse2neon shim | Any aarch64 / Apple Silicon |

## Kernel vectorization coverage

| Kernel | SSE4.1 | SSE4.2 | AVX | AVX2 | AVX-512BW | NEON (arm64) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kswv` (vectorized Smith-Waterman) | 8-wide int16 | 8-wide int16 | 8-wide int16 | 16-wide int16 | 32-wide int16 | 8-wide int16 (native) |
| `bandedSWA` (banded alignment / mate-rescue) | vectorized | vectorized | vectorized | vectorized | vectorized | native NEON blendv |
| `ksw_*` (SW extension free functions) | per-tier | per-tier | per-tier | per-tier | per-tier | per-tier (NEON) |
| `sam_encode` (SAM seq/qual encoder) | per-tier | per-tier | per-tier | per-tier | per-tier | per-tier (NEON) |
| FM-index lookup (`FMI_search`) | scalar popcount | scalar popcount | scalar popcount | scalar popcount | scalar popcount | `__builtin_popcountl` |
| libsais BWT construction | scalar | scalar | scalar | OpenMP parallel | OpenMP parallel | OpenMP parallel |

> **Note — FM-index is memory-bound**
>
> The FM-index backward-extension loop is limited by pointer-chasing through the `cp_occ` arrays, not by computation. Additional SIMD width does not increase throughput here. See [Developer Guide — Apple Silicon / NEON port](../developer-guide/neon-port.md) for the profiling evidence.

## Runtime overrides

Two environment variables tune dispatch:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `BWAMEM3_FORCE_TIER=<tier>` | Forces a specific tier (`sse41` / `sse42` / `avx` / `avx2` / `avx512bw`). Downgrade-only: requests above the host's detected tier (which would SIGILL) and unknown names are rejected with a stderr warning. Used by `test/regression/all_tiers_parity.sh` to confirm byte-identical SAM across all tiers on AVX-512 hosts. |
| `BWAMEM3_DEBUG_SIMD=1` | Prints a one-line `[I::bwamem3_simd_init_body]` startup banner with the build baseline, the detected host capability, and the resolved tier. Also enables the build-baseline-vs-host gap warning. |

Use `bwa-mem3 version` to read the resolved tier without alignment:

```text
v0.2.0
SIMD floor:   avx2 (x86-64-v3, Haswell 2013+); kernels: sse41 sse42 avx avx2 avx512bw
SIMD runtime: avx512bw (BWAMEM3_FORCE_TIER unset)
```

## Why in-process dispatch, not separate binaries

The pre-PR-#83 design shipped six binaries (one launcher plus one
per ISA tier) and `execv`d the matching tier at startup. That worked
but cost ~120 MB on disk, required all six binaries to be present in
the same directory, and made `BWAMEM3_FORCE_TIER` impossible without
re-exec'ing a different file. The current single-binary design keeps
the per-tier compile granularity for the hand-tuned kernel TUs while
collapsing distribution to one file (~25 MB), and adds runtime tier
override and a clean host-floor precheck. Indirect-call overhead is
the only trade-off, and it is below the measurement noise floor on
every architecture in the bench matrix.
