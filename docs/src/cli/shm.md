# shm

`bwa-mem3 shm` stages an FM-index into POSIX shared memory so that subsequent
`bwa-mem3 mem` invocations on the same machine attach to the in-memory segment
instead of re-reading the index files from disk. For workloads that align many
small samples back-to-back against the same reference — such as clinical
panels or amplicon sequencing — this removes the dominant I/O bottleneck.
`shm` also lists and destroys staged segments.

## Synopsis

```text
{{#include ../../_generated/cli/shm.txt}}
```

## Common usage

Stage a standard index, align two samples, then release the segment:

```sh
bwa-mem3 shm ref.fa
bwa-mem3 mem -t 16 ref.fa sample1_R1.fq sample1_R2.fq > sample1.sam
bwa-mem3 mem -t 16 ref.fa sample2_R1.fq sample2_R2.fq > sample2.sam
bwa-mem3 shm -d
```

Stage a methylation index and align:

```sh
bwa-mem3 shm --meth ref.fa
bwa-mem3 mem --meth -t 16 ref.fa R1.fq R2.fq | samtools sort -o out.bam -
bwa-mem3 shm -d
```

List all currently staged segments:

```sh
bwa-mem3 shm -l
```

## Flag reference

### (no flags) `<idxbase>` — stage an index

Loads all index files for `<idxbase>` into a POSIX shared-memory segment.
After staging, any `bwa-mem3 mem <idxbase> ...` on the same machine
auto-attaches and reads from memory rather than disk.

### `-d` — destroy all segments

Removes every bwa-mem3 shared-memory segment on the machine. This is the
correct clean-up command after a batch job and the required step before
re-building the index (see the footgun warning below).

### `-l` — list staged indices

Prints the names of all currently staged segments. Useful to confirm that
staging succeeded before launching alignment jobs.

### `--meth` — stage a methylation index

Auto-appends `.bwameth.c2t` to `<idxbase>` before staging, mirroring the
behavior of `bwa-mem3 index --meth` and `bwa-mem3 mem --meth`. Pass the
same plain `<idxbase>` to all three commands; the c2t suffix is handled
transparently.

## Notes / Gotchas

> **Warning — No staleness check — always destroy before re-indexing**
>
> There is no staleness check. If you re-run `bwa-mem3 index ref.fa` after
> staging, the on-disk index files will not match the in-memory segment, but
> `bwa-mem3 mem` will still attach to the stale segment and silently produce
> incorrect alignments. Always run `bwa-mem3 shm -d` before re-indexing.
>
> **Note — Platform limits**
>
> **macOS:** POSIX shared memory has implementation-defined per-segment size
> caps. Staging a full hg38 index (~28 GB) may fail silently or with a
> cryptic error. Prefer Linux for production use with large references.
>
> **Linux containers:** `/dev/shm` typically defaults to ~50% of physical RAM
> on bare metal but is often much smaller inside Docker containers or
> Kubernetes pods. Raise the limit with `--shm-size` (Docker) or an
> `emptyDir` tmpfs volume with an explicit size (Kubernetes) before attempting
> to stage a large index.
